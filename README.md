# Games  
Repository of simple games I wrote in Python 2.  

These files were created for the course "An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python" (Rice University/Coursera).  

Note: these games were written between March and May 2014 using SimpleGUI.  

**TO DO:** update files to run in another GUI.
